## A multiplayer game engine

This project is built component-by-component over the whole semester of Fall, 2016 at NC State. It involves making a multiiplayer game engine using Processing having features like game object model, network servers and clients, event management system, timelines, etc. This README will eventually have a comprehensive description on how to run my program as well as how the individual components work. 

For now, please have a look at the individual READMEs in the [docs](docs/) folder for the descriptions of each homework implementation.
